## Objective
This project aims to use Python with a pre-trained YOLO (You Only Look Once) model for object detection in two specific scenarios:
1. Reading the sides of movie cases.
2. Counting medicines/pills.

The goal is to deploy this model in a web application using WebAssembly (WASM).

## Steps
1. Install the necessary dependencies (Python, OpenCV, YOLO, etc.).
2. Download a pre-trained YOLO model.
3. Test the model on new data.
4. Convert the model to a format compatible with WASM.
5. Create a web application and integrate the WASM model.
6. Test the web application.
7. Deploy the web application.
